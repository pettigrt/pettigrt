Hello, my name is Tyler Pettigrew. I am a mechanical engineering student at Oregon State University with minors in Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science. I will be graduating
in June 2022. 

I have a strong interest in integrating sensors and control systems with mechanical components. Additionally, I enjoy computer simulations and numerical methods for simulating
systems. 

I can also be reached at tyler.pettigrew1@gmail.com
